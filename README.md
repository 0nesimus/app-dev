## My top 3 favorite movies/series

### 1. **Big Bang Theory**
   - The Big Bang Theory is a popular sitcom that revolves around a group of socially awkward scientists and their interactions with the world around them. The series primarily focuses on Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, two physicists living in Pasadena, California, and their friends Howard Wolowitz, an aerospace engineer, and Rajesh Koothrappali, an astrophysicist. The show explores their personal and professional lives, their romantic interests, and their quirky but endearing friendship. The addition of Penny, an aspiring actress and their neighbor, adds a contrasting dynamic to their scientifically-driven lives.

### 2. **Maze Runner**
